<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm <code>Subhransu Priyaranjan Nayak</code></h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Software Developer and Machine Learning Engineer from India</h3>

## üßê About Me

My journey into the world of mathematics and Computer science began during my early years. I took my first steps into the realm of coding back in 9th grade, igniting a passion that has continued to drive me forward. 

The excitement of discovering new technologies that have the potential to simplify and improve our lives is what keeps me interested outside of the domain of algorithms and programming. My interest in technology and engineering stems from a deep-seated curiosity and motivates me to keep learning and expanding my horizons. 

Instead of spending all my time in the digital realm, I want to explore new places and try new foods whenever I get the chance. Discovering new areas and trying local delicacies is a source of great pleasure and growth for me.
